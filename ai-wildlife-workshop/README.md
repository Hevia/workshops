# Using AI to help Wildlife
This is the code and repo for the AI@UCF AI for Wildlife workshop hosted on 3/11/2021

Workshop recording: TBD

# Setup
Install `flask` and `torch` using the method of your chosing

Run the app using `python3 app.py flask run`

# Exercises
Throughout the workshop we discussed several areas of improvement for the model. Here are some suggestions on where to take this project next:

1.  Improve the model performance, try different architectures, better data, hyperparameters, optimizers, etc
2.  Create a frontend UI for the API, using any framework/language of your chosing!

Completing these extra challenges is enough to create a barebones hackathon submission (possibly even a winning submission!)
