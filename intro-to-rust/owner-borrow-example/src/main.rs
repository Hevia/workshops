fn main() {
    // Ownnership

    y = 5;

    // When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
    {

    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // This is allocated on the heap bc Strings can grow/shrink in size

    // Why is this different from "ownership" above?
    // Read only borrow references
    let r1 = &s; // read only referece, can have unlimited of these!
    let r2 = &s; // no problem

    //let r3 = &mut s; // UH OH, can only have ONE read/write ref OR any number of read references, how do we fix this?
    //println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
    
    // Only ONE mutable borrow reference at a time
    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 is dropped out of scope so we can make a mutable borrow again
