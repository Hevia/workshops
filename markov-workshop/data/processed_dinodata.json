        "Lophostropheus pron LOAF oh STRO fee us is an extinct genus of coelophysoid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 200 million years ago during the boundary between the Late Triassic Period and the Early Jurassic Period in what is now Normandy France Lophostropheus is one of the few dinosaurs that may have survived the TriassicJurassic extinction event Lophostropheus was a small to medium sized moderately built ground dwelling bipedal carnivore that could grow up to 3 m 98 ft long Over the years it had been incorrectly classified as Halticosaurus and Liliensternus but was later recognized as a new genus and was reassigned to Lophostropheus in 2007",
        "Spinophorosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Niger during the Middle Jurassic period The first two specimens were excavated in the 2000s by German and Spanish teams under difficult conditions The skeletons were brought to Europe and digitally replicated making Spinophorosaurus the first sauropod to have its skeleton 3D printed and were to be returned to Niger in the future Together the two specimens represented most of the skeleton of the genus and one of the most completely known basal sauropods of its time and place The first skeleton was made the holotype specimen of the new genus and species Spinophorosaurus nigerensis in 2009 the generic name spine bearing lizard refers to what was initially thought to be spiked osteoderms and the specific name Niger and  ensis refers to where it was found A juvenile sauropod from the same area was later assigned to the genus The subadult holotype specimen is estimated to have been around 13 m 43 ft in length whereas the paratype was about 14 m 46 ft long The shoulder height reached by these individuals was estimated at around 4 m 13 ft and the weight at about 7 metric tons 77 short tons The braincase was short deep and broad  and the neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived neosauropods The teeth were spatulate spoon shaped and had large spaced denticles at the top of the crown an ancestral feature in sauropods The neck of Spinophorosaurus is one of the most completely known among sauropods containing 13 vertebrae The dorsal vertebrae had multiple small air filled internal chambers a feature typical of later more derived sauropods The tail was powered by strong musculature and had a rear section that was rather rigid due to long and overlapping chevron bones Bones originally thought to be osteoderms bearing spikes placed on the tail tip were later suggested to be clavicles Spinophorosaurus has been classified as either a very basal sauropod or inside Eusauropoda a more derived group The anatomy age and location of specimens indicate that important developments in sauropod evolution may have occurred in North Africa possibly controlled by climatic zones and plant biogeography Features of the vestibular apparatus suggest that vision and coordinated eye head and neck movements were important in Spinophorosaurus 3D models of the skeleton have been used to test its range of motion One study suggests it may have been a high browser and another examined possible mating postures Sutures between the neural arches with the centra of the vertebrae were more complex in the front part of the trunk of Spinophorosaurus since stresses were probably greatest in that region Spinophorosaurus is known from the Irhazer Shale a geological formation thought to be Middle Jurassic in age It was formed by deposits from rivers and lakes in a great river valley system",

        "Eoceratops is a genus of ceratopsian dinosaur containing the single species Eoceratops canadensis It is a chasmosaurine ceratopsian which lived during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Western Canada In 1901 Lawrence Morris Lambe at the Berry Creek in Alberta discovered a dinosaur skull In 1902 he named it as a new species of the genus Monoclonius Monoclonius canadensis The specific name referred to the provenance from CanadaThe holotype NMC 1254 was found in a layer of the Belly River Group dating from the middle Campanian It consists of a partial skull lower jaw and front back vertebra of a juvenile animal The head elements include a right eye socket with brow horn the right squamosal and parietal corner of the neck frill and the rear left lower jaw Lambe thought he had also discovered a right jugal but this was later identified as the right nasal bone In addition Lambe referred a right lower jaw specimen NMC 284 found in 1897 and another brow horn specimen NMC 190In 1905 in a publication by Timothy William Stanton and John Bell Hatcher the species was assigned to the genus Ceratops as a Ceratops canadensis This was confirmed in Hatchers posthumous publication of 1907 On this occasion Hatcher additionally referred a maxilla and a tooth and suggested an identity with Monoclonius later Chasmosaurus belli  In 1915 Lambe made it a separate genus Eoceratops The generic name adds a Greek  eos dawn to Ceratops in view of the greater age The combinatio nova is Eoceratops canadensis The type species is Monoclonius canadensis After 1915 several specimens have been referred to Eoceratops One of these was a fossil in 1913 discovered by William Edmund Cutler and unearthed by him in 1920 After Cutlers untimely death American paleontologists presumed it had been stored in Calgary Zoo and had eventually been destroyed However in 2010 it transpired that Cutler had sold it to the British Museum of Natural History and that it was still in its collection as Chasmosaurus specimen BMNH R4948 Another specimen is UALVP 40 a skull excavated by George Fryer Sternberg in 1921 and in 1923 referred to Eoceratops by Charles Whitney Gilmore In 1933 Richard Swann Lull considered it a possible female of Chasmosaurus kaiseni In 1990 Thomas Lehman combined the Chamosaurus kaiseni material with Eoceratops into a new species of Chasmosaurus Chasmosaurus canadensisIn 2010 Nicholas R Longrich named and described skull TMP 1983251 by Lehman referred to C canadensis as a new genus and species Mojoceratops perifania Longrich concluded that the holotype of Eoceratops as that of C kaiseni probably belongs to Mojoceratops This would make Eoceratops a possible senior synonym of Mojoceratops However Longrich also considered the Eoceratops type specimen as too poorly preserved for a reliable determination especially as it belonged to a juvenile individual He stated that Eoceratops is a nomen dubium Longrich also considered the C kaiseni type specimen nondiagnostic and stated it too is a nomen dubium In 2015 Takuya Konishi redescribed UALVP 40 which had been further prepared He noted the presence of a long supraorbital horncore curving upwards He referred the specimen to a Chasmosaurus sp which in his opinion might be identical to Chasmosaurus canadensisCampbell and colleagues in their 2016 analysis of Chasmosaurus specimens found Eoceratops and C kaiseni to be referable to a Chasmosaurus sp as both their holotypes lacked a preserved parietal They also agreed with Maidment  Barrett 2011 that Mojoceratops is a synonym of Chasmosaurus russelliThe holotype represents a rather small individual The squamosal has measured along the outer curve a length of fifty seven centimetres and a width of thirty eight centimetres There are six episquamosalia The juvenile status is confirmed by the short and wide squamosal a short snout and the epinasal not being fused At the base of the nasal horn in a crescent shaped depression the contact facet with the nasal bone is visible seeming to imply the horn is a separate ossification that Lambe in 1915 coined the epinasal The brow horns of Eoceratops are markedly longer than those of Chasmosaurus and with a length of 216 millimetres 85 in attaining twice their base length The brow horns are curved to the rear Lambe assumed that this curvature would not change during growth and thus was a valid distinguishing trait of the taxon Today however it is understood that the horn curvature in chasmosaurines typically reorients itself to the front when an adult age is reached The squamosal side of the neck shield is strongly hooked in front a basal traitIn 1902 Lambe placed Monoclonius canadensis in the Ceratopsidae In 1915 Lambe created a separate Eoceratopsinae to which group also Anchiceratops Triceratops and Diceratops were thought to belong in distinction to a Chasmosaurinae The eoceratopins were assumed to distinguish themselves by more compact and resistant neck shields Today all these forms including Eoceratops itself are considered Chasmosaurinae",
